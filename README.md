Java API for Bose Soundtouch API


## HTTP Client Lib

For the REST Calls I'm trying the Google HTTP Client Library. I've not used this before, but I want 
to try something new anyway. It also supports XML as Body Format (but is beta), but hey: no risk no fun.

This is a helpful example for the XML Usage of the Lib.
